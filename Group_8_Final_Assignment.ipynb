    "For this research, the impact of covid on the freight industry in the Netherlands was examined. On a macro level, the difference in total delivered goods (in tonnes) was examined from 2010 to 2023 for each sector of the freight industry. The examined industry sectors were:\n",

The amount of tonnes transported from 2010 to 2023 for each category was compared in order to see which category was impacted the most by the COVID measures in the Netherlands.
